# Old-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Tic Tac Toe game on Java Microedition (old old old) Using NetBeans that I made just for fun. Names in the code is in spanish due to by the time I wrote it my english was only enough for asking for a hamburger.

The game displays random cats as background, it allows 2 players or against computer modes and there is a hidden track on midi.
